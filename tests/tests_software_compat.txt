# Name: MSYS2
# Version: msys2-20250830
# Download URL/x86_64: https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2025-08-30/msys2-x86_64-20250830.exe
# Download URL/ARM64: https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2025-08-30/msys2-arm64-20250830.exe
# Can use NFS for data storage: yes
# Software can be installed on NFS: Yes, requires global-mount
# Notes:
# - Installation works on case-sensitive NFS filesystems mounted as global mount
# - After installation
#     - edit /etc/pacman.conf and set "SigLevel = Never", because due to a Cygwin/MSYS2 bug there is a mismatch
#     between Cygwin/MSYS2 POSIX uid/gid and Win32 owner/owner_group SIDs
#     - chmod a+rwxt /tmp

# Can use NFS for data storage: yes
# Software can be installed on NFS: Yes, requires global-mount, requires case-insensitive filesystem
# Notes:
# - Requires case-insensitive filesystem for installation on NFS because DLL
# are stored with a different case than they are loaded
# - Requires global-mount, because installer uses different, evelated logon than the caller
# - The *.msi installer does not provide an option to install to a non-standard location, so the *.exe installer is needed
